# AAV : Project of the robot
The project is to make algorithms that will enable to run through several predefined points in the shortest way possible.
In other words, starting from the first point, we have to run through all the other points and come back to the original point in the shortest way possible.

## Algorithms
To achieve the goal described above, we have to code three algorithm.

### Nearest
This algorithm resolves the problem by looking for the next closest point in the circuit. It is not the most efficient way to find the shortest circuit.

### Better

### Optimal
